description: Introduction to Xane, a rollup on Mina Protocol with its own AMM.

Xane (/seÉªn/) is an open source rollup on top of [Mina Protocol](https://minaprotocol.com/) with its own automated market maker.

It is developed by me, [Berzan](https://berzan.org) as a part of Mina Navigators program.

I develop Xane as a [monorope on GitHub](https://github.com/BerzanOrg/xane-rollup) that contains a rollup client, a docs website, a frontend, and packages for common use.

You can reach me on [Mina's Discord server](https://bit.ly/MinaDiscord), if you have more questions.
